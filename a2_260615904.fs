(* In the template below we have written the names of the functions that
you need to define.  You MUST use these names.  If you introduce auxiliary
functions you can name them as you like, except that your names should not
clash with any of the names we are using.  We have also shown the types
that you should have.  It is OK to change a "rec" declaration and put the
recursive function inside a helper if you want to.  Your code MUST compile
and must NOT go into infinite loops.  An assignment like that means you
have not tested it.  You will get ZERO FOR THE ENTIRE ASSIGMENT even if the
problem is only with one question.  If you are not able to get the code to
compile and run do not submit it.  *)
